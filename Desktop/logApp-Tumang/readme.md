# logApp-scaling-octo

logApp-scalling-octo or _logApp_ is a sample application that registers an user's personal information such as Id, Last Name, First Name, and Address through its main _Index Page_. The user has to click the terms and conditions button to fully register his/her data. In the administrator's side, all the data that was inserted by the users can be seen in _Person's log_ including the date and time the user registers. Furthermore, the sample application has _Login Page_ to access _Person's log_ and view the information acquired from the registration through table. And lastly, the _Person's log_ has a _Logout_ button to exit the page.
